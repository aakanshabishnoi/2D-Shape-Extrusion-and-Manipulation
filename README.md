# Babylon.js-2D-Shape-Extrusion-and-Manipulation

This project is built on Babylon.js using Vite as a local development server.

# Steps:
1.Use Babylon.js to create a 3D scene with a ground plane.

2.Implement functionality to allow the user to draw 2D shapes on the ground plane using mouse interactions.

3.Once the shape is completed (a closed loop), provide a UI element (e.g., button) to initiate the extrusion process.

4.Allow the user to move the extruded objects on the ground plane using mouse interactions.

5.Implement functionality to edit the vertices of the extruded object using mouse interactions.

6.Provide visual cues and UI elements to indicate the selected object and active editing mode.
